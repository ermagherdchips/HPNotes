# Harry Potter and the Age of Illusion: Friendship, Loyalty, Courage and Duty
* Symbiotic relationship between readers and books, watchers and films - idea of the characters being real: blurring of myth and reality
* Faulks: modifying our own views
* There is so much that we are not aware of within the Potterverse 
    * If we assume childhood is important, it is significant to know about it for his character, but we know little
    * We also know ltitle about Hermione
    * appropriate to mention this if relevant
* Human themes
* The relationship between heroism and courage is ambivalent - interplay between these characteristics
* Divided loyalty as an important social concept - embarrassing position
* Birth of the 'golden trio'
* Question of what the friends tell each other - do we lie?
* Peter Pettigrew as a friemd - is he courageous?
* Voldemort may exercise control over Peter that we do not know about 
* Does Peter Pettigrew have his Judas moment in the DH?
* What does not knowing much mean - implciation we want to know something more - unfinished and gaps makes it a good series?
* Gaps are filled by Pottermore/fan fiction
* Lily's rejection of Snape - Snape is conflicted between two friendship groups
* House characteristics is more of an immediate reaction and not that they hold a monopoly over that characteristic
* Snape with his love for Lily scene - ambiguities in the language add more depth to the scene (e.g. surely him is her? Is Snape the one crying?
* Duty is very important 
    * Victorian values
    * Notes about duty in citizenship lectures
    * Association with the military = protecting the state 
    * What is right is not necesarily easy
