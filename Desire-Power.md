# Desire and Power
* Mirror of Erised
* Co-join in the desire for power

## Desire
* Pleasure (Hobbes) - links to hedonism and pleasure principles 
* Lust is interesting in teenage years - associated with the Veela, the Sirens of old
    * Allure in the way that boys/men become obsessed with physical beauty - not quite as they seem
    * Driven mad by 'looks alone'
    * Hermione and Ginny's 'lust' for Cedric 
    * Snape's lust for Lily? - less of a sexual sense and more for companionship (differing levels of friendship)
* Desire as wished for is more prominent than lust - can desire be wished for? 
* Linking to obsession 
    * Potentially dangerous if someone is obsessive, implication of an imbalance (compared to a Golden Mean and not going too far one way or another)
    * Voldemort's obsession with life and death, and with power
* Desire as a motivator - needing to balance success at the expense of others 
* Desire is not necessarily something that should be avoided, but it is complex
* Voldemort as the result of failed desire - lack balance and the Golden Mean
* 'It does not dwell on dreams...'
* How does knowledge as power sit with us - are the good and bad sides easy to distinguish?
* Choosing contented over happiness?


## Power
* First PS Quote from Quirrell
* Second PS Quote as a conversation between Dumbledore and McGonagall
* Should not stick to the structures and hierarchies to fit the facts but shaping the theories to fit them instead
* Human beings able to do bad things if they know they will get away with it? - is a virtuous man, they do not need to hide
    * Stuff in Beedle and Bard for stuff about virtue
* Ron's power as childish - wants for material things rather than anything else?
* Dumbledore has the opportunity to bee forgiven and atonement for his sins; and then he falls again 
* Awareness that power is his weakness? - 'I had learned that I was not to be trusted with power... power was my weakness and my temptation' (DH) 
* Mirrors and what has not been sought - sees the Stone because he doesn't want to use it
* 'I think I was a good teacher' (Dumbledore in DH) 
* Puts on the ring for the right reasons - temptation makes him fall again
* Linking to theories of leadership 
* People power - Ron as representative of the Little Man
