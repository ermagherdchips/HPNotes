# Love and Death in the Potterverse
* 'My books are largely about death' - cathartic 
* Department of Mysteries quotes
* Love and death are even more important than magic
* Being the chosen one is a burden for him
* Risk of ensuring the essay is not description but analysis
* Sin Eaters - paying someone to consume your sins 
* Death is there when Harry is young - idea of death in childbirth as a Victorian theme
* Voldemort wanting eternal youth
* Hiding from death under the invisibility cloak
* Harry as a boy of hate - not the best quality; hates Voldemort for good reasons 
* Shifting the vision of death and presenting it to children - chances are this is their first encounter with death
* Cedric does not die heroically
* We learn later that Dumbledore's death was necessary, so that Snape is perceived to be on Voldemort's side
* Was there a necessary sacrifice with Lupin's death?
* The death of Lily sets the whole story up - why is she given the option to 'stand aside silly girl' and doesn't, making her sacrifice all the greater
* Is there a scale of death?
* Dumbledore is obsessed with the way he let his family down
* Is it Voldemort's fault that he doesn't understand love? - idea that we can relate to people as a human quality
