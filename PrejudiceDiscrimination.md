# Magic is Might: Prejudice and Discrimination in the Potterverse
* Imperialism - by definition, it involves an inequality and sense of superiority over one group
* 'Magic is Might': iconography of subjugation, dominance of one group over another 
* When reading HP, we get the *impression* that wizards are superior to non-wizards
    * 'Rejoice' when Harry learns he's a wizard
    * Implication they are a cut above humanity? 
    * Hermione wants to free the house elves for 'the greater good' - how else could she judge it?
* Interference - often well-meaning (e.g. offering advice) is not bullying, but could be dominating/manipulating
    * SPEW as the well-meaning interference
    * Interference the word has negative connotations
* Some are encouraged to bully/dominate as part of the 'game' - domination as the way to succeed
* Neville seems to be bullied by everyone: 
    * Including himself? Inner strength; right at the start he stands up to people
    * Bullied by his own family
    * Bullied by Snape (implied from his home life?)
    * How close to Hufflepuff (associated as being weak, but other Hufflepuffs are not)
* Bullying outsiders - e.g. the squibs/muggles, Filch (but does he deserve what he gets? because he's an unpleasant person?)
* Why does Dumbledore just get rid of Filch and Peeves?
* Is it only when Kreacher is useful to Ron that he is worthy? Hermione always treats him with respect
* Prejudice in the muggle world too because of Harry's *difference*
* Otherness: the other school, the other House, the other place etc.
* Difficult if we consider that prejudice could be well-meaning
* (Martin undermines definitions if he can)
* Karen Brown's *Prejudice in Harry Potter's World*: considers a hierarchy 
    * Do we consider Dobby and Griphook the same on the pecking order as service creatures?
    * Where does Lupin sit as a werewolf and a wizard?
    * Warning against us seeing the Potterverse as representing our own world as an absolute like-for-like
    * Idea of 'actual experience' - we can be prejudiced without facing experiences
    * Martin prefers Black and Atkins' definition - 'the normally accepted standard of that community' is contestable
    * Danger of abuse/bullying if they think that house elves *enjoy* being enslaved - examples of captors
* Prejudice is a contested concept: difficult to pin down definitions
* The Four 'I's: 
    * Ignorance - lack of knowledge; e.g. issue of Harry making natural assumptions about being a Parselmouth
    * Indifference - no concern for the social other; easy to undermine people if we ignore them
    * Insecurity - fear of the social other; by putting someone down in the pecking order, you elevate yourself; Umbridge belittles the others and tries to elevate herself (bullying and dominating others through a sense of inferiority and inadequacy)
    * Intolerance - irrational negative prejudices; Hermione has some intolerances (e.g. of divination)
* Prinzi's comments on intrinsic racism - idea that some people are better than others and, in one sense, the civilisation of the colonial power is much superior to that of whoever they dominate.
* Inheriting prejudice - following the views of their families because they know nothing else?
* 'Gender roles in the wizarding world are still submitted to occupational segregation' (Brown, 186).
* Brown suggests that Arthur is in danger of falling into the preudice trap with his obsession with muggles
