# Magic is Might: Prejudice and Discrimination in the Potterverse
* Imperialism - by definition, it involves an inequality and sense of superiority over one group
* 'Magic is Might': iconography of subjugation, dominance of one group over another 
* When reading HP, we get the *impression* that wizards are superior to non-wizards
    * 'Rejoice' when Harry learns he's a wizard
    * Implication they are a cut above humanity? 
    * Hermione wants to free the house elves for 'the greater good' - how else could she judge it?
* Interference - often well-meaning (e.g. offering advice) is not bullying?
