* Sorting as a cultural genre - leads into different things of prejudice/discrimination, free will and determinism (had Harry been sorted into Slytherin, would he have been any different?), good and evil as inherent of a house, competition between houses vs cooperation of the TriWizard tournament, houses as peculiarly British though not exclusively, houses making a student or the student making the house?
* Growing up - when does this happen?, learning from a children's story full of 'bourgeois values'?, how do we grow up?, learning more from the dysfunction than the order?, character building from mistakes rather than triumphs, bildungsroman, quest, search for enlightenment (are we better for realising that Dumbledore is flawed?), learning for good or ill?, when does growing up end?, reading and re-reading and whether we read the same story again or whether we see the subtleties, agency and leadership?
* Families - lots of them!, individuals are a part of different families, biological and otherwise, difference between the Weasleys and the Dursleys united or divided (they are very different on the surface level, but the characters have many similarities), Percy maligned, taking Fred and George seriously?, control and agency (children standing up to parents)
* Prejudice - obvious theme to Martin now, prejudice against the wizarding world (Petunia rejects it because it rejected her and because it killed her sister; Harry rejecting Draco for his prejudiced views and towards the end Draco seems to modify his views slightly from his prejudice; Ron and Harry's views changing?), prejudice within the wizarding world
* Gender - femininities and masculinities, where characteristics fit within the characters, Neville lacking hegemonic masculinity views on the surface but with a heart/conscious/character which is iron and fits into masculine ideals because of his loyalty but he only fits into the vision of the archetypal hero and classic boy hero , heroism and masculinity, complex roles
* Britishness - curious term, universal values codified at the British empire
* Citizenship - how to live a good life and be virtuous, should Harry have rejected the minister when he asks for help?, is Dumbledore a good citizen?, rejecting his ability to rise to power?
* Fanfiction - Cursed Child as fanfictiony, stuff about Draco's childhood, too much in it? New films added to the canon, what does it say about agency, or the Potterverse, or that we contribute to it and it exists within us and the gaps and unfinished stories are ended, encouraging creativity, linked to the computer age, conventions and fan conventions, art, etc. - phenomena of fan fiction that has not been seen before and will not be seen again
* Magic - using magic to do stuff; just transcendental, magic we feel as readers, fantasy of the novels, destruction of magic from the enlightenment and the industrial revolution; it is an important theme in the books but Harry defeats Voldemort because of his superior moral fibre?
* Ethics - citizenship, what is right and what is good
* Evil - transcendental evil (NO EVIL QUESTION IN ITSELF), evil based on context 
* Rebellion and courage for immorality - DA and OotP and business all should be encouraged to fight against injustice and not keeping quiet about it, encouraging us to voice own opinions; not drifting too far into the real world with this and needs to be cited and not written about in full
* Commodification - price of things, commodification of education
* Postmodernism
* Friendship - golden trio and other friendship groups, loyalty courage and duty linked in with this, is Voldemort defeated by the collective?, ordinary people doing their bit and working together vs the individuals, individually characters are strong but collectively they are invinsible, Ron's importance in the novels (vs the fun character of the books) and his significance
* Loyalty - misguided loyalty threatening it, loyal up to a point, loyal when someone does something wrong but keeping quiet despite knowing you should have stopped them and acquiesing the action
* Courage - scale of courage, going against what we fear for good, Neville as courageous or is he a trope where everyone views him with pity and not as courageous
* Duty - moment when all is lost and there is a sense they are not going to win and yet they have to keep going forwards 
* School stories - Tom Brown's Schooldays, literature and school stories
* Forgiveness - there is a question on this in the essay; everyone wants to be forgiven for something, not just listing characters who want to be forgiven for, forgiveness is complicated and important, then standing outside of this and talking how about it is important outside of the novels and why this is important for us; how is forgiveness important for children; self-forgiveness in the curriculum 
* Atonement - making good from what was bad, atonement for Pettigrew when he dies and atoned for his sins with Harry
* Love is on the exam - trying to not make it limited; familial love?, how we love reading Potter and how we get into the book, enlightenment for charaacters in the book and the readers, love can lead you to do great things but also perverts and taints and can become obsession and can affect individuals (e.g. Snape), golden mean and balance
* Death 
* Reality - if doing this question, make sure it is understandable to people who are not philosophers 
* Enlightenment notes - importance of the journey and the quest (cultural genre), enlightenment as a process rather than a one-off instance; enlightened and learning by doing and learning with others, gradually growing into understanding
