# Lecture 14: Citizenship, Culture and Identity
## Culture and identity
* If identity is who we are, then culture is what we do to prove it
* Richards: 'Culture, in particular popular culture, is the background for identity'
* Citizenship education happens outside of school, as well as in

## Education and citizenship
* Education is formal and informal, inside schools/colleges/universities and outside in the wider world (peer groups, families, interest groups, wider cultural community)
* The formal curriculum is laid down in the national curriculum in state schools
* The extra curricular includes sporting, social, and cultural pursuits
* The hidden curriculum includes codified attitudes, beliefs, and procedures - the way the school is organised
* Citizenship, for all its elevation as a *proper* subject, remains a cross-curricular theme, linked to all subjects on the curriculum
* This is particularly true if one takes citizenship to be a 'state of mind' and a 'code for living'

## Code for living
* A code for living --> Identity --> Social conduct and morality
* Are the above are social constructs - are they 'bestowed by society' or universal constants?
* Code for Living is culture - the government through the national curriculum seeks to mould our character
* In a democracy, this interference is benevolent and benign; in totalitarian regimes, it is sinister and malevolent - but both are forms of social control and manipulation 

## Culture and citizenship
* Citizenship education includes political literacy, participation in community action, tolerance, and respect - all the good positive words linked to citizenship
* Literature, sport, and film are citizenship buzz words
* Moral dilemmas centred on faith and relationships 
* Many good books and films are concerned with codes of conduct 

# Lecture 16: Citizenship, Stories and the School of Morals
## Introduction
* Daniel Kahneman won the 2002 Nobel Prize for Economics and is a specialist on hedonic psychology
    * Looks at *Emotional Psychology* (how you feel about your life whilst living it) and *Life Satisfaction* (how you feel about life whilst thinking about it)
    * The latter is much more important - people spend more time trying to achieve satisfaction than happiness
* Citizenship is about life and is linked to rights and duties
* We need to *learn* how to be a good citizen - about what our rights and duties are
* Citizenship education is about educating us to become good citizens and take our rightful place in society
* Sometimes we are told things which we later grow to understand and accept/reject, or repeat this process
* Most deep learning involves experience

## Stories
* Learning through stories - stories were and are a way to pass wisdom to others, or to make sense of things that have happened
* Stories pre-date the written word - prehistoric stories were later written told, either as they were originally told or perhaps embellished and altered to suit the author/reader
* Some stories are so context-driven that they have little meaning outside that context; others can be told, re-told, and adapted to suit changing circumstances
* Many stories survive from the past, or survive into the future, and contain a moral message - the moral message links to citizenship education and may be concerned with rights, duties, and how to live a moral life

## The School of Morals
* Philip Pullman's lecture - through visiting the theatre, or reading books/watching films, we may 'find instruction or enlightenment about matters of morality'
* This is democratic - we engage in a dialogue with the author and bring our own experiences to bear when thinking about the text/film
* We learn about life and how to be a good citizen through stories
* Faulks says that in fiction, we meet ‘people whose inner lives we get to know so well that they’re more familiar to us than our own families and friends, so much so that it’s in the power of their experiences that we see our own lives in a new light.  …The lives of these characters help us to understand ourselves.’
* Amanda Briggs says that 'Children cannot possibly experience everything through their own lives, but by viewing life through the characters in books they can learn, through them, the morals of right and wrong and reasoned judgement. Some critics claim that fairy-tales and children's fantasy literature create unnecessary fears leading to phobias. However this idea is dismissed by psychologists who suggest that phobias come from real life experiences rather than imaginary ones'
* Mindy: 'C.S. Lewis discussed the negative impact of giving a child an overly sheltered life and argued that "since it is so likely that they will meet cruel enemies, let them at least have heard of brave knights and heroic courage". Other critics see fantasy as a dangerous temptation, offering false impressions of the world and question whether "fairy-tales teach children to retreat into a world of wish fulfilment... instead of facing the problems of the real world". They fail to understand, however, that, as Alan Garner argued, "Myth has always been an attempt to come to terms with the world not to avoid it".'

## Potter
* The whole series might be seen as something of a morality tale with right triumphing over evil in the end
* In the end, Harry defeats Voldemort because he is a better person - Harry displays virtue, the virtue which Voldemort lacks
* Links to the Greeks who valued virtue above all things
* Harry is not universally 'good': in common with the Bildungsroman genre, through his adventures he comes to enlightenment
* More often than not Harry demonstrates virtues of courage, friendship, loyalty and duty - not least when he is prepared to sacrifice himself to save others

## Conclusion
* What should we think of as citizenship, i.e. the qualities of a good citizen
* Virtues of:
    * Doing things for the benefit of others 
    * Volunteering
    * Being willing to compromise
    * Not breaking the law
