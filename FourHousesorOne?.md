## Places in the Potterverse
* Many locations in the Potterverse: The Burrow, Diagon Alley, King's Cross, Malfoy Manor, Grimmauld Place, Ministry of Magic, Forest of Dean, Budleigh Babberton
* Some places transcend the Potterverse and exist in real life, e.g. King's Cross
* Other places resemble real life places, e.g. Diagon Alley resembles York Shambles
* The most significant place in the series is Hogwarts, and the most significant event is the Sorting Ceremony

## The significance of the sorting ceremony
* The ceremony is the most symbolic act in a wizard's life - its significance is only comparable with the choosing of (or being chosen by) a wand
* It is a rite of passage, a formal initiation ceremony is done *alone*
* There is an enormous pressure to get into the right house: '"If you're not in Gryffindor, we'll disinherit you", said Ron, "but no pressure..."' (DH)
* As a boarding school, Hogwarts removes young people from their "real" biological families and replaces them with another - Harry's home becomes Hogwarts, but he also shares a home with the Dursleys and, to an extent, the Weasleys
* They do not always end up in the same houses as relatives (e.g. the Patil twins) - implication that it is not just blood, but personality too, which is significant in the choice
* The sorting hat can be influenced and there is a sense of choice over where we are sorted - "Not Slytherin, not Slytherin" (PS)
* Being sorted can also be close-run: Hermione confessesthat she thought she was going to be put in Ravenclaw (OotP)
* Sometimes the sorting hat makes mistakes which have tragic consequences - 'You know I sometimes think we sort too soon' (Dumbledore)
* Main functions of the sorting hat are: to sort into houses; to pass judgement on the houses and offer advice; to act, alongside Dumbledore, as a philosopher, oracle, and seer (sentient being with intellect?); to help Harry and Neville at critical times when facing Voldemort (due to its origins with Godric Gryffindor?)

## The house system
* May be linked to Romeo and Juliet's families: Four households alike in dignity, 'Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean'?
* Differences exist between the houses:
    * Emblems - lion (G), snake (S), badger (H), eagle/raven (R)
    * Uniforms and shields - red and gold (G), green and silver (S), yellow and black (H), blue and bronze/silver (R)
    * Association with the elements - fire (G), water (S), earth (H), air (R)
    * Common rooms - Gryffindor Tower, Slytherin Dungeon, Hufflepuff Basement (next to the kitchens), Ravenclaw Tower
    * Regalia - sword (G), locket (S), diadem (H), cup (R)
    * Ghosts - Nearly Headless Nick (G), Bloody Baron (S), Fat Friar (H), Grey Lady (R)
* The houses attract different types of students: (PS, p. 126)
    * 'You might belong in **Gryffindor**, / Where dwell the *brave* at heart, / Their daring, nerve and chivalry / Set Gryffindors apart'
    * 'You might belong in **Hufflepuff**, / Where they are *just* and *loyal*, / Those patient Hufflepuffs are true / And unafraid of toil'
    * 'Or yet in wise old **Ravenclaw**, / If you've a ready mind, / Where those of *wit* and *learning*, / Will always find their kind'
    * 'Or perhaps in **Slytherin**, / You'll make your *real friends*, / Those *cunning* folk use any means / To achieve their ends'

## Transfiguration: sorting in education
* The idea of the division of personalities links to Cyril Norwood's (1943) report introducing the idea of the three different types of mind and the tripartite school system
* Can be linked to the idea of certain races being more advanced than others and theories of eugenics
* Comparing to the old collegiate allocation system at Durham, where colleges would choose to admit students based on their traditions and who would fit into which best (as well as creating a pecking order of colleges)
* Implications for different types of university which are ranked by league tables but also by people's perceptions of a certain hierarchy

## Challenging the simplicity of divisions
* Idea that Gryffindor is good and brave, Ravenclaw is wise, Hufflepuff is loyal and friendly, and Slytherin is cunning and bad is simplistic - this can be challenged when we consider some alumni
* Dumbledore - Gryffindor
    * Arguably believed in the greater good, but was this fulfilled?
    * Pays for the bad choices that led to the death of his sister - he is haunted by this
    * Places ambition and friendship above his family - raises Harry like a pig for slaughter so he can die at the proper moment
    * Yet considered to be in the 'good' house - conflict between perceptions and actions
* Horace Slughorn - Slytherin
    * Flattered by Tom Riddle, the 'arch manipulator', who found his weakness
    * Horrified by his mistake and wants to tamper with the memory - but is this necessarily bad?
    * Or is he just ambitious? Or a snob?
* The Malfoys - Slytherin
    * Considered bad due to Lucius' legacy - tarred with the same brush of bad fate
    * While the family are archetypal Slytherin, holding ideas that some families are better than others, they are not necessarily evil
    * During his Judas moment, Draco passes the test - yet despite this sense of good, he is *proud* of his placement in the *bad* house
* James Potter - Gryffindor
    * Are his bad moments allowed because of his sorting into Gryffindor and his assignment as fundamentally good?
* Is the sorting hat correct, either in hsi judgement of individuals or in the qualities of houses?

## Are Slytherins fundamentally bad?
* Hagrid seems to have a negative perception: "There's not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn't Slytherin. You-know-who was one.' (PS)
* It is difficult to pigeon-hole Slytherin alumni, but they are regarded as **ambitious**
    * Ambition is good because it leads one to achieve - but too much ambition is bad, and can lead to obsession
    * Climbing over everyone else just to achieve the ambition may be problematic 
    * If not achieving this ambition, it may lead to disappointment, frustration and madness - is this the case with Snape who became mad as a result of his rejection from Lily?
* It is also associated with **greatness**
    * 'You could be great, you know, it's all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that' (PS)
    * 'After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things - terrible, yes, but great' (PS, Mr Ollivander)
    * Surely the desire to excel is a good thing? 
* Nature/nurture debate is worth considering when trying to fit people into houses - is someone *born* Slytherin, or do you *grow* into it? - sense that identities can be socially bestowed (Antony Smith)

## The house system: pros and cons
* Pros:
    * Offers support and guidance as a home from home (links to the public school system)
    * Gives older students the opportunity to exercise authority over the younger pupils (also similar to the public school system); this is good until it doesn't work, and may lead to bullying or bad things
    * Fosters healthy competition and rivalry between houses, which works to raise standards (market forces foster this, but does it prevent enjoyment?)
    * Offers more opportunities - e.g. four quidditch teams - links to Durham collegiate system
    * Each house is individual - avoids bland uniformity
* Cons:
    * Prefects and older pupils can have, either by design or by accident, a detrimental effect on younger pupils
    * Healthy competition can become out of hand and lead to prejudice and enmity
* The houses are quintessentially English and have been exported around the world
* Inescapably linked to the public school, as presented in Tom Brown's Schooldays
* Does the house system link to the British obsession with class?

## The importance of unity
* 'Though condemned I am to split you / Still I worry that it's wrong / Though I must fulfil my duty / And must quarter every year / Still I wonder whether sorting / May not bring the end I fear / Oh, I know the perils, read the signs / The warning history shows, / For our Hogwarts is in danger / From external, deadly foes / And we must unite inside her / Or we'll crumble from within' (OotP)
    * United we stand, divided we fall 
    * Voldemort sows division, and Dumbledore reminds us that students are more united than divided - need for cooperation
* Dumbledore's Eulogy to Cedric in GoF: 'in the light of Dumbledore's return, we are only as strong as we are united, as weak as we are divided. Lord Voldemort's gift for spreading enmity and discord is very great. We can fight it by showing an equally strong bond of friendship and trust. Differences of habit and language are nothing at all if our aims are identical and our hearts are open'
* The houses unite in opposition with the Dark Lord, but also towards the other schools (e.g. in the Tri-Wizard Tournament)
    * Though there can be differing perceptions of what it is about:
    * '"This whole tournament's supposed to be about getting to know foreign wizards and making friends with them!" said Hermione shrilly. "No it isn't!" shouted Ron, "it's about winning!"'
