## Immorality
* 'Whoever lacks the courage for immorality is suitable for anything, but not to be a moralist' (Nietzsche, *The Will to Power*, p. 397)
* The sense that morality has become just fitting into the system and doing what is expected within society: morality has become superficial, weak, and missed the point
* The Potterverse suggests that there is a deeper morality to be fostered rather than just following the rules

## Character
* Character is a main theme in HP 
* The government is interested in character and schools have begun to have regulations to develop 'character' in children 
* They suggest that the London riots in 2011 show that young people had no character - 'It is difficult to gather quantitative evidence on whether a lack of character in rioters led to their criminal action'
* 'Generation Snowflake' - people are raised to say that they are special and unique, and need to have warnings before being upset, when really they should have more resilience?
* However, young people cannot both be rioting and out of control AND hypersensitive - odd definition of the sense of character

## Character education: today's context
* The Michaela School in Wembly has new approaches to discipline to develop character
    * Emphasis on discipline with no excuses
    * Highly regimented system: learning discipline
    * The child who is compassionate and shares experiences trouble
    * Learning to obey orders without question - is this what we want?
    * Discipline is less about flexibility and more about complying
* The Jubilee Centre for Character and Virtues at the University of Birmingham
    * On character education: 'Moral virtues are stable character traits that enable us to respond appropriately to situations in all areas of life'
    * Once you have virtue, is it actually engraved into you? Do people have stable virtues? 
    * Some people are compassionate in some circumstances and not in others - e.g. in a study, it was found people were more likely to give money when people ask for a specific amount rather than just being asked for change
    * We are more compassionate to people who are like those we are familiar with
    * Deep problems in character education - virtues are variable
* Birmingham Heroes as character virtues - but what do they exemplify?
    * Image of entrepreneurial characters and an Apprentice model (very neoliberal...)
    * Not quiet or generous, but tough and egotistical
    * Current emphasis on 'tough' or 'resilient' virtues - people could be assisted in other ways by the state, rather than having to learn to deal with it
* The Templeton Foundation give the Birmingham group money to do their research: $8.5 million
    * The founder, Sir John Templeton, was interested in 'character development, particularly in gratitude, service and humility'
    
## Problems with character education
* Schools are for intellectual, not moral, development
* Risk of indoctrination through school mottos and ethos
* Virtues are often context specific
* Marginalise the social - people may be beaten down by the system and lose compassion
* Inward turn against the individual
* Which virtues? - are schools left to themselves to choose virtues?

## Which virtues?
* The Birmingham school have created the 'Knightly virtues' 
* Humility, honesty, love, service, courage, justice, self-discipline and gratitude
* Don't these traits contrast with what Knights actually did?
* More about conformity - students at the Michaela school cannot be honest about how they feel about their education because they have to express gratitude
* They wrote the book 'Educating Character through Stories' - has knights on the cover who are neither humble nor grateful but are fighting against each other - emphasis on competition and uniformity rather than individuality and acceptance?
* There are more Muslim children than Christians in Birmingham - these knights foster Christian values in the crusades... problematic
* This is an issue - children should be able to challenge the school world they are brought up in 

## Nihilism
* Nietzsche was interested in the philosophy of nihilism 
* Acquiescence in traditional values
* Indifference to values or refusal to think about them
* Forming values by reaction against their opposites
* No passion about morality and no care about the ideas children are brought up around

## Rule-breaking in British culture
* The children in Harry Potter are not nihilists because they are able to stand up against the rules
* In the UK political and moral thinking, there is a strong and important tradition of valuing the breaking of rules
* Tom Brown's Schooldays considers children in trouble
* The Beano comics react against the rules (e.g. Dennis the Menace) 
    * Do we not want the children to be naughty a bit because it would be unbearable if they just conformed all the time?
    * Feistiness and reacting against rules can geenerate comedy
* Without breaking laws, nothing changes - e.g. Suffragettes broke the law, and we do not criticise their actions and we almost admire them

## The limits of laws/rules
* Laws and rules are trumped by other things that are important
* Humanity, compassion, the 'greater good'
* These virtues are built into the Harry Potter plot
* The affirmation of life is important: 'the plentitude, the strength, the will of life, its courage, confidence and future' (Nietzsche, *The Genealogy of Morals*, Preface, 3)
