# Harry Potter: Hermione Granger and the Goddamn Patriarchy: Thinking about Gender in Harry Potter
## 1&2. Feminist readings of Harry Potter
* Literature is descriptive and prescriptive 
* Initials in her name to appeal to all genders rather than just females?
* Reiss and War Literary Theory reader (link on DUO) for more feminism
## 3. Challenging gender
* Example of type one: Wood makes the mistake of addressing the team as men and corrected - depicting structural inequality and calling it out
* Example of type two: 
* Doing both
* They are not feminist novels or sexist novels - more complex
    * Contradictory perspectives
    * Novels for boys? - next week
## Exploring gender positively
* Heilman and Donaldson chapter in Critical Perspectives
    * Reinforce gender stereotypes 
    * Example of Hermione having to be rescued as 'disappointing' - 'absence of powerful females'
    * Easy to cherry-pick passages to support the argument - doesn't give a real understanding of PS dynamics
    * Ignores the instances where male characters are shown to be terrified (Ron & spiders in the forest)
* Example on slide 5 of Ron's luck: Hermione teaching the spell
    * Only her aptitude and willingness to construct Ron that he can perform it 
    * Not a damsel in distress - provides the resources for the rescuer to rescue 
    * Sacrificing her own good standing and placed in risk of punishment to protect classmates  
    * Both rescued and rescuer to Harry and Ron
* Fear is not gendered as a female response in the novels - both female and male characters experience fear and are in need of rescue
* Examples of articles
* Insulting terms of 'bossy' and 'know-it-all' used by peers and Snape (PoA) - subjected to other people's patriarchal expectations to diminish herself to fit in to prevent others feeling inadequate
    * Adichie novel extracts: Hermione refuses these expectations of *girls*
    * Unapologetic about herself despite it potentially leading to her being unpopular
* Hermione is not a *perfect* character - pettiness, arrogance, impatience etc. - but shares traits all have
    * A perfect Hermione would not serve a feminist function or be an engaging character in HP 
    * Literary characters that are purely good/evil are not engaging as they are unrealistic/two-dimensional
    * Any literary depiction that idealises/fetishises an oppressed group is lacking - needing more complex/fully realised female protagonists who are as relatable as male characters
* Positive female role model

## Lacking a patriarchal challenge?
* Cultural assumptions that emotional intelligence is a female/feminine trait - emotion work performed *best* by women
* Emotion work coined by Hochchild - "the management of one's emotions in private contexts"
    * Guardian article translates this into practice - being in the background
    * Emotion work predominantly done by women, but shouldn't be gendered
    * Yet another form of unpaid labour done by women to a disproportionate degree
* Study on emotion work - linked to societal gender construction rather than biological sex 
    * Expectations of women
* Emotion work in Harry Potter obviously done by Hermione (DH: 'I notice I'm always the one sorting out the food because I'm a girl I suppose')
    * Modulating her own emotional responses based on the responses of her male best friends
    * Preventing them getting into trouble - slide 16 - justified response, but Hermione is the voice of reason despite her sadness too
    * She can control her emotional response in order to avoid unhelpful confrontation/negative consequence
    * Relied upon by other characters to interpret the behaviours of others: Goblet of Fire 'jealous' scene (Ch 18), she interprets how he is feeling
    * Instance in Ch 21 of GoF - 'emotional range of a teaspoon' - emotional intelligence is gendered in HP
    * Less for political reasons, but more for humour in this particular example - humour from disparities in emotional intelligence of male and female characters
* Ron depicted as clueless and cowardly in relationships - pretending to sleep, looking to sabotage the relationship rather than discussing it (slide 19) - discomfort with expressing emotions is gendered as male
    * Males who are emotionally literative are non-hegemonic - e.g. Neville, Lupin, Dumbledore, Hagrid (simultaneously physically masculine yet nurturing maternal instinct)
* Lupin suffers societal rejection due to his lycanthropy - trauma in his adolescence, lost his friends in the 1st WW 
    * Not possessing hegemonic masculine characteristics - wealth, strength, power etc. 
    * First introduction to Lupin (slide 20)
    * Lupin did not bully Snape: slide 21 - not standing up to his friends (lacking courage to do so) but finds it problematic 
    * Coding Lupin as a non-hegemonic male as possessing more emotional intelligence than average
    * Surrogate father and mentor figure for Harry 
* Is Harry Potter a non-hegemonic male?
    * Physical appearance at the beginning is not masculine: slide 22
    * Holds special social status as 'the boy who lived' - successful masculine indicator
    * Discovers he is rich, a natural sportsman, owning exclusive objects (e.g. invisibility cloak), romantic successes with the 'prettiest girls' at Hogwarts
    * In the mirror he does not see riches, but a loving and secure family unit - remains his desire throughout the series (more next week) - compared to Ron, who sees him winning the house cup and everyone around him idolises him
    * What he values most is a stable family unit, what he desires most is fairness and decency (hence sharing info with Cedric and encouraging both to triumph; whereas hegemonic would seek victory himself)
    * Sacrifices his certain victory to rescue Ron but also Fleur's sister because he's afraid of her harm 
    * Rejects Draco's offer of friendship in PS because of this value of fairness? - in favour of true friendship with Ron who is fro a more challenged socioeconomic family and Hermione who is a muggle-family and Luna who is 'insane' 
    * Affirms his commitment to his assortment of friends (slide 23) - true friendship rather than those which bring him material gain or increased social capital
    * Quotes on 24 - more possibilities for boys and broader definitions of the masculine
* Same with her females - Hermione, Luna, McGonnagal etc. - variety of expreessions of femininity
* Gender not predicted as a determinant or limitation in HP
