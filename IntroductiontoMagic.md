*The main argument of this lecture is that the Enlightenment made us lose touch with the natural 'magical' world, and this may be why children in the UK are the least happy. This may also be why we love Harry Potter so much.*

## The purpose of magic
* Magic may be associated with **manipulation** - a way of getting things done and asserting our will
    * Some critics of the Harry Potter books (mostly from the US) claim that the stories are just about children getting their own way, this time with wands.
* Magic may be associated with **escapism** - it is something beyond our world that we have lost
    * Can we return to this magical perception through the innocence of children/animals?
    * Classrooms may be shutting out the external magical world so children can focus on the teacher and an education that may not be as beneficial as that outside world (progressivism)

## Happiness (or, its absence)
* UNICEF Report Card (2007) identified that 'Britain's children are unhappiest in the Western world'
* This unhappiness is expressed through the idea of 'mental disorders' (YoungMinds, 2017)
    * 7.7% (340,000) children aged 5-10 have a mental disorder
    * 11.5% (510,000) young people aged between 11-16 have a mental disorder
* 'The true measure of a nation's standing is how well it attends to its children - their health and safety, their material security, their education and socialisation, and their sense of being loved, valued, and included in the families into which they are born.' (UNICEF, 2007)
* 'People in the West have got no happier in the last 50 years. They have become much richer, they work much less, they have longer holidays, they travel more, they live longer, and they are healthier. But they are no happier.' (Layard, 2003)
* Rather than there being something wrong with the individual, is there something wrong with society?
* Is it that the extraordinary external world is pushed out of humans' lives? Do we now find the world unmagical?

## Humans and the magical world: Neolithic period
* People have found cave paintings in France of horses
* We know this is not an instrumental image - who teaches people to hunt in a cave?
* There is speculation that these represent early human beings' magical relationship with the world
* Painting is used as an expression of their feeling that the animals around them were not so different from themselves
* Early humans were close to the natural world - this sense of closeness has been lost

## Humans and the magical world: Julian Jaynes
* He wrote 'The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind'
* He identified that early human beings did not think 'I ought to do this' because they had a separated brain - any 'oughts' were commands from God
* Now, we have a unified brain, but we still have elements of this pre-modern consciousness in schizophrenic hallucinations or in hearing the voices of people saying things even though we don't 'hear' it

## Humans and the magical world: witches
* Magic used to be seen as a threat in European history and this was embodied by witches
* In the Middle Ages, witch-burning was used by the church in an attempt to eliminate magic
    * These 'witches' were stereotypically old women who were not well integrated into a community and knew older knowledge (e.g. herbs)
    * This knowledge was not tolerated by the church, so they attempted to remove it
* In Macbeth, he goes to the witches to influence the future and know who is not dangerous - unable to manipulate magic

## Humans and the magical world: the Thirty Years' War
* 1618-1648 fight between Catholic and Protestant countries in Middle Europe (e.g. Germany, Austria, Poland, Czechoslovakia), but rapidly became wars between armies and mercanaries too
* There is a painting of the fight on Charles Bridge in Prague which shows Christ on the cross in the background - religious wars
* As a result of this war, Descartes arose superstition and questioning of magic, because people simply believed what they were told - this led to the Enlightenment

## The Enlightenment: replacing magic with reason
* This period is generally known as the 'Long Eighteenth Century' and the 'Age of Reason'
    * *Siecle des lumieres* - century of the lights
    * *Aufklarung* - light
* Sense that people should use reason and include that in their day-to-day lives
* Diderot developed his *Encyclopedie* (1772) which attempted to include all knowledge in one book
* Kant identified the era's motto as *sapere aude* (dare to know) - being bold enough to gather knowledge for the self rather than relying on the knowledge of the priests
* We are the heirs to this age - universities founded and shut out the magical
* Enlightenment blowing away the last elements of magic

## The effects of the Enlightenment at the time
* When writing the American Declaration of Independence, the language was changed from 'we hold these truths to be *sacred and undeniable*' to 'we hold these truths to be *self-evident*'
* Diderot wrote that childish ideas should be removed - 'All things must be examined, debated, investigated without exception and without regard for anyone's feelings... We must ride roughshod over all ancient puerilities [childish ideas], overturn the barriers that reason never erected, give back to the arts and sciences the liberty that is so precious to them'
* Is this why Harry Potter is perceived to be a children's book?
* The old magic was not going away despite the Enlightenment - at the very moment of showing rationality, magic reappears

## The Enlightenment's legacy today
* Schools are no longer governed by nature but by efficiency and effectiveness in acquiring results
* There is a bureaucratic system and a loss of myth and enchantment
* This system became universal - rationality became the widespread way of understanding, even in communities that were most akin to nature
* Horkheimer and Adorno wrote that 'the fully enlightened earth radiates disaster triumphant'
* Romanticism tried to hit back against the Enlightenment
    * We have an ability to respond to the natural world, but until we see something that we own in nature we are not interested
    * Wanting to commit to magic and a natural world, but this is an outdated set of beliefs
* These ideas also emerge in gothic culture
