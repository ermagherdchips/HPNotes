# Forgiveness, Atonement, and Redemption
* HBP quote: from fact to guesswork - uncertainty
* War causes on there because the topic is dangerous 
* Most sinister line in the film (not in book) - telling us about the differences between them?
    * Idea of deserving punishment
* These words are important - clearly linked to other things (theology - notion of guilt for example)
* Deflect giving definitions - all guilty of something
* The tale of good and bad, etc. - binary opposites 
* Do the characters ever forgive themselves? Some characters are riddled with guilt
* Doing nothing the same as doing right? 
* Christian morality from the Bible, but also interpretable in different ways and thus morals are a bit more wobbly?

## Forgiveness
* Repaying of a debt, righting of a wrong, etc.
* Do we need to feel remorse before asking for forgiveness?
* Linked to repentence? - feeling sorry before we repent?
* Selective and doing one thing justice, narrowing focus rather than trying to cover all grounds

## The Characters
* Whatever was being talked about **changes over time** - we might have a view of these things that changes; e.g. citizenship
    * Things that we would say that were socially acceptable once are no longer socially acceptable
    * Acknowledging this is good! 
* If quoting someone - make sure we acknowledge their context; where did they get these thoughts from?
* Notions of guilt - is guilt an absolute? Does it diminish over time? Does this suggest that guilt moves? Is there a scale of guilt?
* The need for forgiveness - consider alongside relationships where people need to be forgiving 
* Atonement for past sins - we are not pure and we are what we are; we cannot hide behind this 
* National Curriculum: forgiving themselves

## Dumbledore
* Is his later life restitution for his crime? Is this what he's trying to do?
* Seems to refuse the position of Ministry of Magic, is this why?
* Dumbledore punishes himself for his past decisions 
* Crimes 'in his head'? - does this make them real? - unable to turn things off in the head
* We know little about Aberforth
* What is the relationship between Dumbledore and Snape?
* Relationship with himself is important
* 'You cannot despise me more than I despise myself' (HBP?)

## Snape
* Is pity the same as sympathy? Or feeling sorry for them?
* Is his love for Lily selfish? 
* Is Snape capable of forgiveness?
* Different perspectives are important 

## Harry
* Free will and determinism of the prophecy
* How much is he the manipulator or the manipulated?
* Is he a saviour figure?
* His people do die...

## Malfoys
* Draco: Do we forgive him?
* Considering Lucius: he forgives Voldemort? Does Voldemort deserve our pity?
* Tom Riddle lacking remorse? 
* 'Be a man' is importnat
* Can we judge him?
