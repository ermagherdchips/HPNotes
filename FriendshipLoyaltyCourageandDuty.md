## Introduction
* The Harry Potter series is about many (often linked) things: identity (or *identities*), personal journeys, growing up, prejudice and discrimination, gender issues, magic (instrumental or otherwise), education, good and evil, morality and moral choices
* There are also some debates surrounding the series: the book/film debate, the role of fanfiction, and the nature of reality are important
* Indeed, there is a symbiotic relationship between readers and books, watchers and films - idea of the characters being real blurs the boundaries between myth and reality
* For us, the most important thing to consider is how the Potterverse shines a light on our world
* Readers and watchers care about the novels and the films - we are *with* Harry 
* Our perceptions change the more we read and re-read, watch and re-watch, the series
* We relate to the story and it becomes part of us - we enter the Potterverse and the Potterverse enters us
* We look at the characters as real people and we judge them accordingly - they become *our friends*
* As Sebastian Faulks (2011) said: In fiction we meet 'people whose inner lives we get to know so well that they're more familiar to us than our own families and friends, so much so that it's in the power of *their* experiences that we see our own lives in a new light. These characters live beyond their times, and beyond the page - in our imagination, in our memory; and on both the big screen and the small. The events that befall them shape them as people, but they affect us too. The lives of these characters help us to understand ourselves.'
* Our identity is subconsciously modified as we become invested in the series
* It is important that we largely view the canon through Harry's eyes - he is the only character we really get to know
* There is so much that we do not know in the Potterverse - not just the plot, but the characters
    * What do we know about Hermione's childhood?
    * What do we know about Draco's childhood?
    * Why does Pansy Parkinson stand up and denounce Harry (DH)? Does she have secrets we don't know about?
* These gaps help to fuel the fanfiction, which makes the Potterverse almost unique
* The story is about the human condition - it is important to readers on a personal and human level
* There are a range of human themes in the novel: hope, ambition, love, relationships, friendship, loyalty, courage, heroism, duty

## Friendship 
* In PS, the golden trio is born: 'But from that moment on Hermione Granger became their friend. There are some things you can't share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.' (PS)
* What do we mean by friendship?
* What are friends for?
* Do friends tell us what we want to know, or what we need to know?
* What's the difference between friends and acquaintances?
* What about fair-weather friends?
* What about imaginary friends?
* Are the golden trio *our friends*?
* What does the canon tell us about the true nature of friendship?
* The golden trio is the ultimate friendship group: 'There was a silence in the room, broken only by gentle thuds, as Hermione continued to throw books on to one pile or the other. Ron sat watching her, and Harry looked from one to the other, unable to say anything. The measures they had taken to protect their families made him realise, more than anything else they could have done, that they really were going to come with him and that they knew exactly how dangerous that would be. He wanted to tell them what that meant to him, but he simply could not find words important enough.' (DH).
* There are lots of seeming friendships and friendship groups that we can consider: when caught in the Shrieking Shack, Wormtail calls Remus and Sirius 'My friends... my old friends' (PoA) 
* We know of one person who made the wrong choice when it came to his friendship group with tragic consequences:
    * '"...thought we were supposed to be friends?" Snape was saying. "Best friends?" / "We *are*, Sev, but I don't like some of the people you're hanging around with!" ... / "What about the stuff Potter and his mates get up to?" demanded Snape. His colour rose again as he said it, unable, it seemed, to hold in his resentment.' (DH)
    * "Mulciber and Avery's idea of humour is just evil. *Evil*, Sev. I don't understand how you can be friends with them" (DH)
    * "'...I never meant to call you Mudblood, it just -" / "Slipped out?" There was no pity in Lily's voice. "It's too late. I've made excuses for you for years. None of my friends can understand why I even talk to you. You and your precious little Death Eater friends - you see, you don't even deny it! You don't even deny that's what you're all aiming to be! You can't wait to join You-Know-Who, can you?"' (DH)
    * '"I can't pretend any more. You've chosen your way, I've chosen mine." / "No - listen, I didn't mean - " / "- to call me Mudblood? But you call everyone of my birth Mudblood, Severus. Why should I be any different?"' (DH)
    * "'She and James put their faith in the wrong person," said Dumbledore coldly. "Rather like you, Severus."' (DH)
* Hufflepuff is the *friendly* house, but they do not have a monopoly over friendship
* Link to virtues: 'In love, one entrusts part of one's soul to another, in a fashion: a friend shares another's joys and sorrows and acts for his good, even when sacrifice is required. Friendship strengthens the soul's integrity: friends become better people by acting for the other's good and building virtue. In short, loving makes us more fully human' (Bassham, *The Ultimate Harry Potter and Philosophy*, 62)

## Courage
* Is heroism the same as courage? - This relationship is ambivalent 
* Courage is linked to circumstance
* In the end, was Peter Pettigrew courageous?
    * 'This is magic at its deepest, its most impenetrable, Harry. But trust me... the time may come when you will be very glad you saved Pettigrew's life' (PoA)
    * '"You're going to kill me?" Harry choked, attempting to prise off the metal fingers. "After I saved your life? You owe me Wormtail!" The silver fingers slackened.' (DH)
    * 'His own silver fingers were moving inexorably towards his own throat' (DH)
    * Did he have a choice? - is pity bravery?
* Are some people braver than others?
* 'McGonagall, Flitwick and Sprout all thundering after him: [Snape] hurtled through a classroom door and, moments later, Harry heard McGonagall cry, "Coward! COWARD!"' (DH)
* Harry to Snape: "Kill me like you killed him, you coward" (HBP)
* Was Snape the 'bravest man'? (DH)

## Loyalty
* Can we have friends who are not loyal? If they are not loyal, do they cease to be friends?
* What does divided loyalty mean? - important social concept
* "You must have shown me real loyalty down in the Chamber. Nothing but that could have called Fawkes to you" (PoA)
* '"Dumbledore's man through and through aren't you, Potter?" / "Yeah, I am" said Harry. "Glad we straightened that out." (HBP)
* Are the Death Eaters loyal?
* What about blind loyalty?
* What about being loyal 'up to a point'?
* Was Hermione loyal to the cause and to Harry when she stayed? Did she betray Ron?
* Whom can we trust in a series of shape shifters?

## Duty
* Duty is often regarded as one of the great Victorian values
* It is not easy to define - yet we all have an idea of what it means
* It can be associated with citizenship - a counter-balance to *rights*
* Associated with the military - the ultimate function of the state is to protect the people; and in return the people protect the state - war is the ultimate sacrifice, and 'England expects every man to do his duty' (Nelson)
* More in line with the prosaic and legal notion of offering a service in return for recompense
* Repaying a debt - idea of an *obligation* - one has a duty to do what is right
* What is right is a deeply contested concept - Dumbledore talks about the choice between doing 'what is right, and what is easy' (GoF)
* Examples of duty - to one's school/house, to one's friends/family, to the *cause*, to the government
* Is duty to one thing greater than duty to another?
* Duty is linked to guilt and conscience
