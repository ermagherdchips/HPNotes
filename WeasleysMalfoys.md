## Introduction
* There are concerns about family values *declining* as the nation stands on the edge of ruin
* Changing is more apt than declining
* Evidence that the popularity of marriage is declining and divorce rates are rising
* Connected to the idea of a disaffected youth (those aged 35 and under) - young people are contributing to the worsening state of the nation
* Families are important in current society and in the Potterverse

## Families in the Potterverse
* The series promotes family values in different ways
* It is not good enough to say that there are lots of families, but we need to consider how these families are represented
* There are few broken families or families with same-sex parents - reversion to stereotypes of ideal family life?
* Concerned with what we mean by families as a form of identity - gangs and associations of the Death Eaters, the Order of the Phoenix etc.
* Most significant failies are the Malfoys and the Weasleys - despite their regard as polar opposites they have more in common than it seems
* Is the Potterverse itself a family? - unites people in the canon and the fanbase
* Larger family of the wizarding world/muggle world
* 'Your house will be something like your family' (*PS*)

## Context of JK Rowling
* Her biography is important because most authors reflect on their own experiences (whether explicit or implicit) in their writing
* She was born in the post-war era in 1965: 'cultural bulldozers' (Thompson) were at work, and the pillars of society (police, careers, marriage, families) were being cracked and adapted - life was in a state of 'natural gloominess' (Paxman)
* JK Rowling's family relationship was close: her mother died in 1990, 7 years before PS
    * Motherhood is important to Rowling - her death influenced her writing
    * She noted (somewhere) that 'death is on every page' of her novels
* In terms of her own family, she was a single mother from 1993, but got remarried and had more children in 2001
* She suffered from clinical depression and considered suicide - dementos as a commentary on these emotions
* Supports charities which help single parent families, alleviate poverty, help orphans, and fight diseases
* If these things are relevant to her life, they may permeate her writings

## The theme of families
* Membership - who becomes family? (blood, adoption, informal structures)
* Loyalty - who belongs in the family and remains loyal
* Role models - the parents of the family and older siblings/prefect system
* Habits - ways of functioning within the family unit (e.g. eating at the dinner table etc.)
* Values - depending on their morals and habits
* Home - as a congregation point, with individual rooms (sometimes) for members
* Education - having the same education; having a family within the educational institution through mentoring
* Changes - few characters in the HP series remain the same throughout

## The Weasleys
* They are pure-bloods, descended from 'The Most Noble and Most Ancient House of Black
* They come across as poor in the books, but this is relative (they live in a nice detached country home)
* They are a tight-knit extended family, all members of Gryffindor and supporters of the Order of the Phoenix
* They are generally considered a good family

### The Burrow
* Perceived in different ways by Ron and Harry: '"It's not much", said Ron. "It's brilliant," said Harry happily, thinking of Privet Drive' (*CoS*)
* The Burrow provides a *home* that Harry cannot remember from his early childhood 
* The Weasleys (nature/peace) are the antithesis of the Dursleys (commodification and consumerism)
* The Burrow is a rural idyll - idea of quintessential Britishness/Englishness
* Burrow in the ground - warm, safe, and comfortable
* Located in Devon (Ottery St. Catchpole) - famous British place-name
* Constructed of wood - the wood of 'old England' and perhaps old magic relates it to trustworthiness and a sense of growth
* Construction itself is almost a British hotch-potch design
* At the heart is the kitchen - the dining situation is important
    * Link to British ideals of dining habits to eat and talk to each other to maintain family values
    * Ethos of the family is established during meal times in the intimate dining setting
    * Wood, with no modern appliances
    * Rural idyll with hints of magic
* Their automated knitted jumpers are important as it marks the members of the family out as members of said family - uniform
* Their lounge is a Victorian ideal, cluttered and functional
* The inner sanctum of the bedroom is important for the Weasley children - it can be personalised and is linked to their identity
* At the Burrow, lots of family events take place - Harry's first real birthday part, Bill and Fleur's wedding, the death eater attack (film)

### Accepting outside members
* Harry is welcomed from the start and has a variety of relationship dynamics
    * He is mothered by Molly
    * He is worshipped by Ginny - until she grows up, and views him as an equal
    * He is envied by Ron
    * He is fathered by Arthur, one of his surrogate fathers (Sirius, Dumbledore, Lupin, Hagrid)
    * All remain loyal to Harry
* They welcome Phlegm into their inner circle once she proves that she is worthy. Harry as an orphan elicits pity from the start; Fleur as Veela arouses different emotions
* They are fiercely loyal to one another and are potentially an ideal family

### Members of the family
* Molly - she is a positive character, archetypal mother earth (bosomy and comforting); but has flaws (uncomfortable with Arthur's roommate at St Mungos - talked about in OotP)
* Aunt Muriel is a minor character and is ignored
* The sons Charlie and Bill had important roles at Hogwarts: Charlie was the Quidditch captain, Bill was head boy
* Percy is a head boy, and fairly pompous, but does not enjoy himself because he is surrounded by Fred and George - obsessive with following the rules and is ambitious 
* Fred and George are admired characters, offering comedic light relief throughout as caricature figures - they are pranksters, but they are also out of control (disrupting the plans of Dolores Umbridge, disruptive in the OWLs, categorically bullies)
* Arthur is viewed as a good father who has a dotty and laid-back character - almost a Dickensian character, being poor but happy and slowly working his way through the ranks of the Ministry
    * However, the scene in *CoS* where he loses his temper is not put into the film - do we defend his actions because he was defending his family?: '"We have a very different idea of what disgraces the name of wizard, Malfoy," he said. "Clearly," said Mr. Malfoy, his pale eyes straying to Mr and Mrs Granger, who were watching apprehensively. "The company you keep, Weasley... and I thought your family could sink no lower - " There was a thud of metal as Ginny's cauldron went flying; Mr Weasley had thrown himself at Mr Malfoy, knocking him backwards into a bookshelf.'
    * He also steals from his employer (the car) and misuses the artefacts that have been confiscated - do we have double standards because he is on the side of right over might? Is he more relatable?

## The Malfoys
* Pure-blooded family, descended from 'The Most Noble and Most Ancient House of Black'
* They are ostentiously rich and live in Malfoy Manor
* They are a tight-knit nuclear family which supports each other as a unit
* All are members of Slytherin house
* Generally considered to be a bad family
* The wizarding aristocracy is characterised by their pure-blood obsession
* Narcissa's sister, Andromeda, disgraced the family when she married Ted Tonks and their child married a werewolf - historical ideas of marrying close to the family is reproduced

### Lucius Malfoy
* Obsession with pure-bloodedness and a hatred of muggles
* In Beedle the Bard, he writes 'Any work fiction or non-fiction that depicts interbreeding between wizards and Muggles should be banned from the bookshelves of Hogwarts. I do not wish my son to be influenced into sullying the purity of his bloodline by reading stories that promote wizard-Muggle marriages'
* Contemptable figure that we know little about - complex
* Voldemort himself describes him as 'my slippery friend' (GoF)
* His one virtue is placing family above everything else - in the final battle his concern is to find and protect Draco
* The Malfoys are ultimately forgiven for their previous misdemeanours and escape imprisonment - class thing?

### Narcissa Malfoy
* She was never a death eater and was prepared to defy Voldemort's plan for Draco to assassinate Dumbledore
* She persuades Snape to make the unbreakable vow
* She values Draco, her only son, a lot and he is a motive for a lot of her actions

### Draco Malfoy
* He is a spoilt child and a snob: 'You'll soon find out that some wizarding families are much better than others, Potter. You don't want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there' (PS)
* He is doted on by his mother and dominated by his father who puts enormous pressure on him
* He is forced into trying to kill Dumbledore to save his family - fiercely loyal
* However, he does not betray Harry when he could have rehabilitated his family's fortunes during his Judas moment

## Mothers
* JK Rowling's relationship with her mother is hugely important to the Potterverse
* Just because her mother died does not mean that their relationship has (is this what is important with the ghost animals spirits?)
* Mothers and motherhood have an enormous impact on the Potterverse
* Lily, Narcissa, Molly, and Petunia are all biological mothers
* There are also surrogate mothers (e.g. Minerva McGonagall and Hagrid), and other mothers (Dumbledore's, Luna's, Neville's)
