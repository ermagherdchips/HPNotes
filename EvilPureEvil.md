## Evils
* There are two types of evil:
    * Transcedental - incomprehensible, e.g. the Dementors
    * Ordinary, empirical - part of this world, understandable actions
* We consider the Holocaust, terrorism, violent rape, kidnapping, and mass abduction evil
* Soldiers committed suicide after their actions in the Vietnam War - awareness that they were not controlled, but it was them that caused this 'evil' (choices)
* Could we understand torture as it gets information to stop further evil? This is a dilemma in this world

## The religious heritage of evil
* Our ideas of evil are fundamentally attached to Christian views in the West
* Awareness that there were bad things, but no concept of evil
* In the Garden of Eden, the serpent was the opposite of the good God and hence the evil 
* Rebel angels wanted to take over heaven - this created evil in our world
* Hard to make sense of a notion of evil without Satan and the fallen Angels
* Why is taking the apple a bad thing to do? - Eve usurped the wisdom of God and did not trust that he was right
* Images of evil are found in religious art in the western world

## Transcendental evil
* Religion is transcendental 
* Do the Dementors and Voldemort come from religious traditions, or are they more like recent evils?
* Rowling states that Voldemort is evil because he was conceived under a love potion and thus cannot feel love innately
* Does Rowling have a coherent theory of evil? To what extent do the Dementors come from this transcendental position, while Voldemort has an empirical evil due to his origins?
* Voldemort places evil into a Horcrux: conjuring images of evil which are both transcendental and empirical at once
* There is a sense that Voldemort is a dark evil and Dumbledore is a light good - but Dumbledore is not a transcendental good, and Voldemort is not purely transcendental evil

## Evil in the real world
* The abduction and murder of Jamie Bulger is usually assumed to be evil 
    * The children were used to seeing violence glorified 
    * Potentially assigning them as 'evil' to give up on helping those who have bad backgrounds?
* Considering other examples: Baby P, Ian Brady, Joseph Fritzel etc. - do we say that these people are evil because we cannot make sense of what they are doing?
* Jimmy Saville used a position of power to attack children - deviousness adds to a notion of evil
* Terrorist events - Lockerbie, 9/11, Hitler
