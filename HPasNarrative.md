# Harry Potter as Narrative
## Narratology
* The study of narrative and narrative structure - looks at what different narratives have in common, and what makes one different from another
* Based on the idea of a common literary language/universal pattern which operate within the text of a work
* Communicated through media
* The books offer a plot and structure form that is familiar to them, and therefore is comfortable to engage with - the folk/fairy tale
* Propp's views of folktales looking for common patterns - 'grammar of narrative', set of rules that describe and prescribe how stories are structured - morphology - reduceable to 31 functions of narrative (building blocks)
    * Absence - something is missing: absence of Harry's parents
    * Interdiction - warning about what should and should not be done: magic is forbidden in the beginning
    * Violation - warning is ignored: trip to the zoo, accidentally practices magic
    * Reconisence - contact is made: owls and the letters
    * Delivery - getting deeper into trouble
    * Trickery
    * Something else
    * Villany
    * Mediation
    * Beginning counteraction
    * Departure 
    * Tested
    * Provision of magical aid 
    * Transferrence to another kingdom and journey: Hogwarts Express; transferrence from muggle to magical
    * Struggle
    * Branding: marked by his scar, marked as a hero before the book even begins
    * Victory - initial misfortune is remedied
    * False hero
    * etc.
    * Don't always happen in the sequence given here - can attach them to the narrative in any order/shape, not prescriptive order
* These functions will not always look the same and be enacted in the same ways
* The functions are limited to only these 31
* Only actions which seem unlike can be examples of narrative 'function' - while these actions are different, they are all examples of the function that the hero receives a magical agent
* Characters can be categorised into 7 broad character functions:
    * Villain - opposing the hero: Voldemort; Umbridge; Snape; Mrs Dursley; Draco; Peter Pettigrew; deatheaters
    * Dispatcher - any character illustrating the need for the hero's quest and sends him off to do it: Hagrid (comes to collect Harry from his confinement, who brings him to consciousness of his magical ability)
    * Helpter and donor - very similar functions (helper is magical who comes to help the hero in quest; donor prepares the hero for the quest, sometimes after testing)
        * Helpers: Hermione, Dumbledore, Dobby, Ron, Neville
        * Donors: Hermione (gives Harry not physical objects but knowledge he needs to be successful), Dumbledore (calling on the sword of Gryffindor), Sirius Black (broom), Fred and George (marauders map)
    * Hero - Harry
    * False hero - Lockhart takes credit for the hero's accomplishments
    * Princess - technically Ginny (is she a damsel in distress? she is rescued in CoS), but what their marriage represents is not accession to wealth and power (Harry has all that already), but he wins the oppportunity to build a family life (subversion of the structure)
    * Some characters may be fitted into two or more functions
* Not saying that Harry Potter is a formulaic text or unoriginal text


## The orphan in literature
* Orphan protagonists are often the most beloved characters in literature
* Disproportionately prevalent in both children and adult literature - familiar and well-used character in literature
* 'Unwilling suspension of disbelief' (Coleridge) at the idea that parents would hold back children
* If children are to engage in adult activities, the parents must be absent - a child with parents lacks autonomy and free will
* A child without carers is an autonomous being - they must fend for themselves and develop their own moral compass without parental guidance
* Stock character - orphan protagonist was particularly popular in European sentimental fiction 
* Common elements with orphaned protagonists across the world - plot devices and tropes; deep structure (Tropp)
    * Mistreatment and isolation - not enough they're an orphan, but they must be further defined by hostility which stems from jealousy or envy because others are aware the orphan has a latent power
    * Human or supernatural helpers - fairy godmother idea, step-parents, employers, pets, etc.
    * Quests or journeys - Thompson 'the performance of difficult tasks is frequent in orphan folktales'
    * Obstacles on the journey - often a family member imposing hardship on the orphan; supernatural forces
    * Surmounting obstacles
    * Rewards - often marriage
    * Punishment of those who oppose orphans - often death
* HP contains all of these traditional elements - he is mistreated and isolated by the Dursleys because of his magical abilities; aided by supernatural helpers; each book is in and of itself a specific quest narrative, and he has to surmount obstacles in them; the 7 novels altogether show an overarching quest to defeat evil; his reward is not special status, because he had this all along, but the chance to be a normal boy


## The boarding school story
* The boarding school narrative is a modified form of the orphan narrative - removes childrne from their parents where they must make their own decisions away from the guidance of their family members
* Not orphans in the strictest sense, but these children are removed from their family setting and are required to flourish in a different setting - freedoms and responsibilities of the orphan protagonist
* Imaginative appeal of the boarding school narrative - J. K. Rowling interview
* Wish fulfilment for young readers - allows the child/adolescent reader to imagine independence from the family unit without the trauma of parental death and orphanhood
* Bringing together of two genres of children's literature - this and the fantasy genre 
    * This may seem novel, but Jill Murphy's 'Worst Witch' series in 1974 
    * Was phenomenally popular at the time; young witch arrives at a school of magic
* Karen Manners Smith - summation of the things common to the boarding school narrative
* Hogwarts is not the self-contained world of the school in more traditional boarding school narratives - in others, the dramas the protagonists face are only important within the world of the school

## Fantasy genre
* Sub genres identified by Manlove - secondary-world, comic, subversive, childrens etc.
* These categories are somewhat outdated - HP can fit in more than one category
* Further subgenres - urban fantasy; paranormal romance; dark fantasy (meets horror); superhero fiction; 'high fantasy'
* Secondary world - in an alternative world to ours - worlds are supernatural and different to our own
* Epic fantasy - borrows from the Russian folktale
* Maps onto different series
* Harrys' experiences are fantastic, but the world he lives in outside of term is within our understanding - not high fantasy, but intrusional fantasy/low fantasy
* Set in our primary world, incorporating supernatural elements
* Magical realism 
* The structure and plot arc of the individual books are remarkable consistent with works of high fantasy - epic fantasy of the hero's quest is evident
* In low fantasy, we have more subgenres -
    * Portal fantasy: the secondary world is entered through a portal (e.g. the wardrobe in Narnia; rabbit hole in Alice); there is the brick wall to get to Diagon Alley, flushing toilet into the Ministry - but not a portal fantasy, as magic can be practiced anywhere not just in the secondary world
    * Magic rudely intrudes into the lives of muggles, which are the most comic moments in the books adn the films
* Though HP might be a fantasy work and its narrative structure is familar, the power of the book (as Beers believes) is not in its fantasy setting, but in the truths that it teaches us about normal human relationships
