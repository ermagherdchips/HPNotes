## Harry Potter and literacy
* A Waterstones 'Harry Potter Report and Survey' (2005) found that the book series had increased literacy levels and enthusiasm for reading, particularly amongst young male readers
* 59% of children feel that the Harry Potter books helped them to improve their reading skills
* Nearly 50% said that Rowling's series made them want to read more books
* 41% said that the Potter books made reading *cool*
* 84% of teachers said that the books had a positive impact on children's reading abilities
* 73% admit that they were surprised by the children who managed to read Harry Potter
* Nearly 66% told how Harry Potter had helped to turn non-reading pupils into readers
* More than 33% felt that the books had more impact on literacy than the National Literacy Strategy

## The concept of literacy
* Literacy is defined as the ability to read/write
* True and meaningful literacy is not just functional - considering oneself and self-identifying as a reader is important
* In *Children's Literary Practices and Preferences: Harry Potter and Beyond*, Sunderland, Dempster and Thistlethwaite say that the series encourages further reading and moving forward
* Functional vs holistic literacy is affected by Harry Potter

## Children's literature and good and evil: origins
* Literature was historically a means of moral instruction: good characters are rewarded, bad characters are punished
* Characters in children's literature are generally modelling a simple good/bad behaviour pattern
* In fairytales, the distinction between good and bad characters is obvious - a dichotomy is perpetuated
* Some books enact cultural truism to suggest that good cannot be ugly (e.g. *The Twits*)
* Harold Bloom notes that Shakespeare was the first writer to give a psychologically complex, fully-realised character
* However, these fully realised characters took longer to get into children's literature 
* Lemony Snicket writes something which suggests that children's literature is more sophisticated now: 'People aren't either wicked or noble. They're like chef's salads, with good things and bad things chopped and mixed together in a vinaigrette of confusion and conflict' (2004).
* The good/bad dichotomy is so normative thatit becomes parodied 
* Complicated even further in teen fiction as we encounter morally ambigious characters and common but taboo issues 
* Assumption that books can taint morals - but books can also affect them positively

## Good and evil in Harry Potter
* Considering how good is physically visible:
    * However, Tom Riddle is described as handsome in early descriptions, but there are signs of evil in GoF and HBP
        * 'The thin man stepped out of the cauldron, staring at Harry... and Harry stared back into the face that had haunted his nightmares for three years. Whiter than a skull, with wide, livid scarlet eyes and a nose that was flat as a snake's but with slits for nostrils' (GoF)
        * 'There was no trace of the Gaunts in Tom Riddle's face. Merope had got her dying wish: he was his handsome father in miniature, tall for eleven years old, dark-haired, and pale.' (HBP)
        * 'Riddle lifted his head. His face was transfigured: there was a wild happiness upon it, yet for some reason it did not make him better looking; on the contrary, his finely carved features seemed somehow rougher, his expression almost bestial.' (HBP)
        * 'It was impossible to tell what he was thinking; his face remained quite blank as he put the little cache of stolen objects back into the cardboard box' (HBP)
    * Sometimes, physical appearances can be deceptive - Snape, Gilderoy, Sirius Black, Umbridge
        * 'five-time winner of Witch Weekly's Most-Charming-Smile Award' 
        * 'a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin', 'cold and empty eyes', 'an overgrown bat'
* In the series, there are lots of complex characters: Narcissa, Snape, Sirius, Dumbledore, Draco
* Harry doesn't always behave as well as he might
* Bad characters can surprise us by acting bravely/selflessly
* We are able to experience sympathy towards the 'bad' characters
    * '"She wouldn't even stay alive for her son?" / Dumbledore raised his eyebrows. "Could you possibly be feeling sorry for Voldemort?" / "No," said Harry quickly, "but she had a choice, didn't she, not like my mother..." / "Your mother had a choice too," said Dumbledore gently. "Yes, Merope Riddle chose death in spite of a son who needed her, but do not judge her too harshly, Harry. She was greatly weakened by long suffering and she never had your mother's courage" (HBP, Ch. 13)
    * Though he is unquestionably the villain, we learn more about why he is as he is
* HP helps readers to appreciate that the world and people in it are not easy to 'sort' - Gryffindors can be cowardly (Pettigrew), Slytherins can be driven by love not ambition (Narcissa)
* The series is valuable for working with bereaved children - meadium for bereavement management/resolution
* Harry as a model of courage and resilience
* If we live through fictional characters on a neurological level, being bereaved by reading a book, we experience these losses as if they were real, and therefore prepare us for real losses - blurring fiction and reality 

## Empathy and emotional intelligence
* Emotional intelligence is a kind of emotional literacy 
* Modelling complex situations within the text can help us to be morally good
* Reading texts like HP can help children to learn about other people in the world around them - practicing empathy and 'theory of mind' (understanding how others think/act)
* Young people who read narrative fiction are more likely to do well in an emotion eye test
* Reading as 'taking in a peace of consciousness'
* Able to develop empathy for a different race/culture - half-blood/muggles, werewolves, magical creatures
* Good characters in HP model desirable civic behaviours by treating different groups with respect
* Are the readers of HP self-selecting and thus already tolerant though?
* HP resonates with milennials because it is narrative fiction - it allows insight into thought processes and psyches of the characters, allowing us to 'get to know' them and become emotionally invested
