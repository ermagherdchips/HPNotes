## Introduction
* One suspects that there are some who condemn HP as an out-dated public school tale extolling middle-class values
* It is undeniable that Hogwarts is like a public school
* Is Harry Potter like Tom Brown, and is Dumbledore like Thomas Arnold (eulogised as a myth, blur of myth/reality)?
* The public school system influenced the importance of pastoral care in schools, and led to a development of the prefect system which is now prominent in many schools

## The Britishness of schooling
* There is something British (or, English) about school
* Schools and schooling are not uniquely British, and even private schools aren't, but they have an influence
* [Isabel Quigly](https://library.dur.ac.uk/record=b1021648~S1): 'School is still an emotive word in this country; less so than it used to be but still able to raise a degree of nostalgia, interest, love, hatred and antagonism unlikely, indeed incredible, almost anywhere else. **School clings through later life**... because the type of education it gives, in a country where **education is anything but uniform**, marks the mind and to a great extent conditions intellectual development for good; it clings because it conditions (much less than it used to, but still very noticeably) future occupation, place in the world, niche, manner, personality, tastes and attributes'
    * The public school system has a powerful influence on individuals' identities
    
## Schools and Harry Potter
* [Pico Iyer](http://www.nytimes.com/books/99/10/10/bookend/bookend.html) (1999) describes the similarities between Hogwarts and the Dragon School in Oxford, comparing Hogwarts to a real British school
* Pennington agrees: Hogwarts is 'essentially a realistic description of common British schooling practices, with the magic an awkward touch sprinkled in'
