## Introduction
* One suspects that there are some who condemn HP as an out-dated public school tale extolling middle-class values
* It is undeniable that Hogwarts is like a public school
* Is Harry Potter like Tom Brown, and is Dumbledore like Thomas Arnold (eulogised as a myth, blur of myth/reality)?
* The public school system influenced the importance of pastoral care in schools, and led to a development of the prefect system which is now prominent in many schools

## The Britishness of schooling
* There is something British (or, English) about school
* Schools and schooling are not uniquely British, and even private schools aren't, but they have an influence
* [Isabel Quigly](https://library.dur.ac.uk/record=b1021648~S1): 'School is still an emotive word in this country; less so than it used to be but still able to raise a degree of nostalgia, interest, love, hatred and antagonism unlikely, indeed incredible, almost anywhere else. **School clings through later life**... because the type of education it gives, in a country where **education is anything but uniform**, marks the mind and to a great extent conditions intellectual development for good; it clings because it conditions (much less than it used to, but still very noticeably) future occupation, place in the world, niche, manner, personality, tastes and attributes'
    * The public school system has a powerful influence on individuals' identities
    
## Schools and Harry Potter
* [Pico Iyer](http://www.nytimes.com/books/99/10/10/bookend/bookend.html) (1999) describes the similarities between Hogwarts and the Dragon School in Oxford, comparing Hogwarts to a real British school
* Pennington agrees: Hogwarts is 'essentially a realistic description of common British schooling practices, with the magic an awkward touch sprinkled in'
* Since the 19th century the English school system, and the public school, has generated a range of creative art and literature, with Harry Potter as one of the most popular manifestations
* Fictional schools share characteristics, but all have their own unique song, teachers, uniforms, and codes of behaviour (similarly to real schools)

## The importance of popular culture
* Childhood is important in British culture - we have kept the Victorian mythologising of childhood as a special part of the lifespan
* [Richards](https://library.dur.ac.uk/record=b1373690~S1) discusses the importance of popular culture, literature, and childhood
* 'It is generally acknowledged that popular culture holds up a mirror to the mindset of the nation. It distils, generates, and confirms sets of values, attitudes and ideals which for good or ill cohere to form the national identity' - changes over time
* Richards defends popular culture from those who claim that its influence cannot be measured: 'the pattern of consumption of popular culture contains unconscious evidence, arguably more valuable because it is unconscious' - it is not thought about, but simply happens
* 'If we hope to discover the inward thoughts of a generation, it is to literature that we must look' - importance of literature to children
* 'In particular reading in childhood when the mind is at its *most impressionable* has a lasting effect. Sir Charles Grant Robertson said in the 1930s of films that they leave a kind of sediment in the mind' - childhood reading is important and remains part of their ideas; they may not necessarily be seditious in that it is negative, but it does have a lasting impact on values and expectations
* Fiction is not only a 'social product' but also something that 'produces society': 'if fiction plays a large part in the socialisation of infants, in the conduct of politics, and in general gives symbols and modes of life to the population, particularly in those less-easily defined areas such as norms, values and personal and interpersonal behaviour'

## Harry Potter and Tom Brown
* When first published in 1997, *PS* was inevitably linked to what was the most famous of the school stories, *Tom Brown's Schooldays* 
* Both take place in a public boarding school; both have a boy hero which has adventures and forms friendships (quest narratives); both involve a school bully and nemesis (who is not necessarily who it seems and start to be re-evaluated); both have an 'omnipotent' headteacher (but also ae re-evaluated throughout)
* There are several differences however: Rugby is single-sex while Hogwarts is co-ed; Rugby had an overly Christian ethos, which is more overt in Harry Potter
* *TBS* helped to generate two myths: Thomas Arnold, and the public school as an institution (ICE Lecture 7)
* Blurring myth and reality: if we believe the myth sufficiently, does it become reality? Can we choose to have a reality when we want one?

## The moral universe of the school
* Linked to both the positivist and anti-positivist ethos:
    * Positive: the official position of the school, formal curriculum and extra-curriculars
    * Anti-positive: what actually happens in the classrooms, common rooms, and dormitories
* Schools, like all institutions, are unique places with their own peculiar set of rules and values, which contribute to the organisation's ethos and *moral universe* 
* The moral universe encompasses things such as rules and codes of behaviour, some of which are written but others simply understood
* Some things are formally inducted into the ethos (e.g. sorting ceremony), while others pick up things over time
* Separate groups within the school (e.g. sports teams) may have their own ethos
* It is often acceptable to bend the rules and not break them - blurring boundaries
* Dumbledore forgives his favoured pupils when they do something wrong, and sometimes rewards them (e.g. in *CoS* Dumbledore does not expel Harry and his friends but gives them special awards and 200 house points each)
* Dumbledore also actively encourages Hermione to use the Time-Turner, a serious rule-breaking offence
* There is a double-standard of rules, similar to this, with Arthur Weasley and his stealing from the Ministry and using tactics to get to his desired end

## Hogwarts' moral universe
* Selective entry requirements which may disrupt family life (e.g. Lily and Petunia)
* The curriculum - the examination system, the teachers and their methodologies
* Rewards and punishments (who receives and gives them)
* Hierarchy of staff and students (Heads of House > Head Boy/Girl > Prefects)
* Social groupings, buildings and common rooms
* High table and the formal meals system - very theatrical
* House colours
* Sports - 'it's more than a game, it's an institution' (TBS)

## Schools to develop character
* The purpose of the public school is about the *moulding of character* alongside intellect - in 2014, Nicky Morgan announced a package of measures to help schools to instil character into their pupils
* In *TBS*, we see about the importance of developing character: 'Shall I tell him to mind his work, and say he's sent to school to make himself a good scholar? Well but he isn't sent to school for that - at any rate, not for that mainly. I don't care a straw for Greek particles or the digamma; no more does his mother... **If he'll only turn out a brave, helpful, truth-telling Englishmman and a gentleman and a Christian**, that's all I want.'
* Trollope describes his experiences at Winchester: 'There we learned to be **honest, true and brave**. There we were trained to disregard the softness of luxury, and to love the hardihood and dangers of violent exercise. **There we became men**: and we became men after such a fashion that we are feared or loved, as may be, but always respected - even though it is in spite of our ignorance. Who can define the nobility that has attached itself to Englishmen as the result of their public schools'
* George William Russell writes of the Shadow of Tom Brown: 'In ancient shadows and twilights / Where childhood had strayed, / The world's great sorrows were born / And its heroes were made. / In the lost boyhood of Judas / Christ was betrayed'
* Most schools concern themselves with the socialisation of the young to accept the agreed norms of society - schools reflect society
* When Snape is headmaster, the moral tone of the school changes and reflects the Ministry under Voldemort - he can do what he can to ameliorate the worst excesses, but cannot openly oppose the ministry
* In contrast, Dumbledore is often at odds with the Ministry under Fudge, and gets away with it - more freedom from the ministry

## Comparing Thomas Arnold and Albus Dumbledore
* Dumbledore's influence in the wider wizarding community was much greater than Arnold's was, even in the narrower educational community of the nineteenth century - however, both were strong and influential figures
* While Arnold used the pulpit in his attempt to make Rugby a Christian community, Dumbledore used the Great Hall to transmit his messages to the pupils of Hogwarts
* Both headmasters are concerned with the moral welfare of their pupils and the pastoral system is the greatest legacy of the schools
* Both had loyal followers and gained the trust of those around them
* Both were dominant figures - though Arnold was ensuring his governors were subservient to his will, in *CoS* Lucius' governing body are able to force Dumbledore out of office and able to break this loyalty

## Potter and British identity
* Public schools were supposed to reflect so-called Victorian values and the virtues of the English gentlemen
* They helped to form the national character and British values: fair play, stiff upper lip, sense of superiority, ability to stay calm in a crisis, British sense of humour, a belief in the value of amateurism and muddling through - all found in Potter
* This may be contrasted with the British values of the British curriculum: democracy, rule of law, individual liberty, mutual respect for and tolerance of those with different faiths and beliefs - these are also found in Potter

## Potter and Victorian values
* The importance of family life
* Decency and honesty
* Hardwork and self-reliance
* Discipline and self-restraint
* Progress and creativity
* Philanthropy and voluntariness
* The English gentleman
* Racial superiority
* Parliamentary government
* Law and order (obedience to authority) 
* Religiosity
* There are also associations of hypocrisy, exploitation, arrogance, poverty, cruelty, neglect, and civil unreast with the Victorians
