## Citizenship
* Citizenship is about life itself - it can be easily related to the Potterverse
* Being a good citizen is often associated with being a good role model - what constitutes a good role model is often context-bound and can be seen to change over time
* The concept of citizenship is old - the Greeks wrote about it
* Implication that a citizen has *rights*
* In return for these rights, citizens must peform *duties*
* Citizenship as a noun and a verb
* Concerned with one's relationships with the state and with others (citizens/non-citizens, groups, other individuals)
* As well as being a badge of one's legal status, being a good citizen is linked with *active* words and values
* Being a good citizen means that we take responsible action and do the right thing, both for our community and the state
* Whilst the notion of *pure citizenship* might not have changed, what gives it its flavour is the **context** in which it operates
* Citizenship is linked to:
    * Morality and values - sense of right and wrong
    * Active participation in affairs
    * Obeying the law (in a democracy, contributing to its creation)
    * Taking responsibility for one's own actions
* According to the architects of the Citizenship National Curriculum Orders (which espouses democracy as a good thing) it promotes concepts such as freedom, tolerance, fairness, respect for truth, and respect for reasoning
* Citizenship is emphasised now because it is regarded to be a 'time of crisis' 

## Citizenship and Harry Potter
* Is Harry Potter a good citizen?
* Harry's adventures are often focused on the educational world in a formal (school) and informal (home/peers) sense
* The stories are about growing up, rites of passage, finding one's place in society, and *learning* how to make a positive contribution towards society, now and in the future
* After leaving school, the main characters make a positive contribution to society: Harry becomes a policeman, Hermione becomes a lawyer (then Minister for Magic), Neville becomes a teacher, Ron becomes a policeman, Draco becomes an entrepreneur/banker
* Many characters display a number of positive values, which may be British and *Victorian*
    * Many of these may be associated with characters on the 'wrong side'
    * The ambivalence, the identity and character changing nature fo the protagonists, makes the Potterverse intriguing
* We see the action through Harry's eyes - with all that that implies
* The following citizenship things happen:
    * Decency and honesty
    * Hard work and self-reliance
    * Discipline and self-restraint
    * Bravery
    * Loyalty
    * Generosity
    * Fairness
    * Trust
    * Duty
* After rescuing him, Aberforth tells Harry to hide and look after himself rather than continuing with Dumbledore's plan to defeat Voldemort. In explaining his actions, Harry says 'sometimes you've got to think about more than your own safety! Sometimes you've got to think about the greater good! This is war!' (DH)
    * Links here with doing one's duty in a time of crisis
    * 'The greater good' - this is something Harry **has** to do
* There are examples in which an individual might display counter or opposite characteristics - might tell us much about their true identity - Sirius reminds us that there is good and bad in all of us (when referring to Umbridge) (OotP)
* Importance of choice and identity
* Voldemort is not a good citizen - he is selfish and intolerant; annd the friendless and deserted child falls in the end because he cannot show remorse
* At times, even the good characters like Dumbledore have flaws - this paradoxically makes them more believable, accessible and acceptable in today's society, and consequently more readily acceptable as role models
* The most complex character, Snape, is one of the most unattractive in the series and a bully - but he is *brave*

## Questing
* For the main characters the adventures are in the form of a medieval quest - are the Deathly Hallows the Holy Grail of the Arthurian romances?
* On the quest, there are several themes which are linked ot being a good citizen and learning to take your place in society:
    * Self-discovery of identity
    * Acceptance (part of the Diversity Agenda)
    * Forgiveness (part of the Curriculum 2000)
    * Redemption

## Morality
* A sense of right and wrong
* Throughout the stories there are choices to be made
* 'It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities' (PoA)
* 'Remember, if the time should come when you have to make a choice between what is right, and what is easy, remember what happened to a boy who was good, and kind and brave because he strayed across the path of Lord Voldemort. Remember Cedric Diggory' (GoF)

## Rule-breaking
* There is law and rule breaking throughout - inevitably for the *good* guys in a *good* cause
* Harry, Ron, and Hermione use mind drugs on several occasions, and use violence, often against Malfoy
* Their attempts to unseat the government are in a long tradition of acceptable protest
* May link to a freedom fighter/outlaw dichotomy

## Relationships
* The whole saga is about relationships - some forged, some broken, some remade
* There are personal one-to-one relationships, or between small groups
* Relationships between houses
* Relationships between children and adults (teachers, parents, others) - and between adults themselves

## Tolerance, forgiveness, and respect
* Uncle Vernon: 'I don't mean to be rude...' and Dumbledore's reply: 'yet, sadly, accidental rudeness occurs alarmingly often. Best to say nothing at all, my dear man.'
* Dumbledore tries to become a spokesperson for good - 'we are only as strong as we are united, as weak as we are divided. Lord Voldemort's gift for spreading discord and enmity is very great. We can fight it only by showing an equally strong bond of friendship and trust. Differences of habit and language are nothing at all if our aims are identical and our hearts are open.'
* Luna about Ron: 'he says very funny things sometimes, doesn't he?... But he can be a bit unkind. I noticed that last year.' (HBP)
* Ron about Luna: 'She's great, isn't she... Always good value' (DH)
* At various times the good guys are mean, disrespectful, self-centred, opinionated, intolerant and abusive - but this makes them more believable and their negative qualtiies are overcome in the end
* Overcoming negative character traits is part of the rite of passage to full citizenship - creating role models

## Conclusion
* Harry Potter is undoubtably a good citizen
* In his journey of self-realisation, he searches for his true identity so he can fulfil his destiny - as in all morality tales, the hero gets his just reward
* For Harry, his reward is the most precious thing he had lost at the very start before his odyssey begins - a family
* Citizenship is concerned with families and belonging
* The series says a lot about citizenship and about playing one's part in wider society and working towards the 'greater good'
* Citizenship links to the moral universe of the school; and the idea of Britishness
* What about Harry's refusal to help the government?
* 'They looked at each other, long and hard. Finally Scrimgeour said, and with no pretence of warmth, "I see. You prefer, like your hero Dumbledore - to disassociate yourself from the Ministry?" / "I don't want to be used," said Harry. / "Some would say it's your duty to be used by the Ministry!"' (HBP)
* Can Harry be thought of as a good citizen but a poor role model? - he is flawed 
* These flaws are endearingly attractive and make him a real human being
