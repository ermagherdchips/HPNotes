# Harry Potter, Children's and YA Literature, and Emotional Intelligence
## Concept of literacy
* HP has increased literacy levels and enthusiasm for reading amongst young male readers
* Literacy = the ability to read/write
* True/meaningful literacy is not just functional - considering oneself and self-identifying as a reader
* Sunderland, Dempster, & Thistlethwaite: encouraging further reading, moving forward
* Functional vs holistic literacy affected by Harry Potter

## Children's literature and good and evil
* Historically viewed as a means of moral instruction: good characters rewarded, bad characters punished: characters in early CL model good/bad behaviour
* The Christmas Box - virtue becomes a habit
* Fairytales - distinction between good and bad characters is obvious
* Dichotomy between good/bad, beauty/ugly is perpetuated in Disney films
* Cultural truism in *The Twits* - idea that good cannot be ugly
* Tom Riddle is described as handsome in early descriptions, but there are signs of the evil within in GoF and HBP
* Villains loooking and acting like villains - can see why Snape is more suspected for evil
    * Quirrel using this to his own advantage - Harry learns that evil may take the appearance of good or vice versa
    * Learns this many times over - physical appearances deceptive
    * E.g. Gilderoy, Sirius Black, Umbridge 
* Harold Bloom - Shakespeare was the first writer to give a psychologically complex, fully-realised characters
* We don't see these fully realised characters in children's lit until later (end of 18th century)
    * Bad behaviour is no longer seen as synonymous with bad character
    * e.g. *The Purple Jar* - educational remit to the text: Maria Edgeworth is not a bad character, she just has made a bad choice
* Good people can behave badly or vice versa made clear in Tom Brown's Schooldays
* Lemony Snicket quote: children's literature is more sophisticated and less didactic
* Good/bad dichotomy is so normative that it has become parodied by some - e.g. Lynne Reid Banks' Angela and Diabola
    * Good prospers and bad perishes, but without her bad twin she becomes more rounded and realistic 
* Complicated further in teen fiction - routinely encountering morally ambiguous characters
    * Relatively new form of literature - 1942; 'Golden Age' in the 1970s with Judy Blume
    * Exploring common but taboo issues - frequently challenged/banned
    * Commitment to moral ambiguity as an aspect of real life, and a refusal to tidy up messy situations in Blume's books
* Morally ambiguous characters were a norm in YA fiction prior to HP, but it was still rare to come across such complexity in children's fiction pre-HP

## Good and evil in HP
* Complex characters in HP: Narcissa Malfoy, Snape, Sirius, Dumbledore, Draco Malfoy
* Harry doesn't always behave as well as he might
* Bad characters can surprise us by acting bravely/selflessly
* There are few characters who are purely evil or purely good - difficult to identify with a character that is unbelievable
* Not encountering people who are perfect
* Able to make us feel sympathy and empathy with Voldemort - HBP quote
    * Unquestionably the villain of the series, but as we learn more about his origins we learn why he has become that way
    * Speaking of his origins in the Leaky Couldron webpost
    * Not trying to learn why Voldemort is how he is, but not simply condemning his mother for her choices
* HP helps readers to appreciate that the world and people in it are not easy to 'sort' - Gryffindors can be cowardly (Pettigrew), and Slytherins can be driven by love not ambition (Narcissa)
* Assumptions that books can taint morals - books must also be able to affect them in a positive way
* Series is valuable for those working with bereaved children - medium for bereavement management and resolution
    * Connecting with fictional characters also experiencing loss can help our own feelings
    * Harry is a model of courage and resilience
    * First encounter with loss in a fictional text? - if we live through fictional characters on a neurological level, being bereaved by reading a book, we experience these losses as if they were real, preparing us for losses in real life

## Empathy and emotional intelligence
* Emotional intelligence as a kind of emotional literacy
* Modelling complex situations within the text can help us be morally good
* Reading texts like HP can help children to learn about other people in the world around them - practicing empathy and 'theory of mind' (understanding how others think/act)
* Young people who had read narrative fiction were more liekly to do well in an emotion eye test
* Reading as 'taking in a piece of consciousness'
* Developing empathy of a different race/culture - half-blood/muggles, werewolves, magical creatures 
* Good characters in HP model desirable civic behaviour by treating different groups with respect
* Whether reading HP can reduce prejudice [(2015 study)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jasp.12279/abstract) - one group reading scenes related to prejudice, the other reading scenes that did not - then measuring views towards stigmatised groups
* [Milennial readers of HP](https://library.dur.ac.uk/record=b2797319~S1): are they self-selecting however, as in already tolerant?
* HP resonates with milennials because it is narrative fiction - allows insight into the thought processes and psyches of characters, which allows us to 'get to know' fictional characters and become emotionally invested in them
