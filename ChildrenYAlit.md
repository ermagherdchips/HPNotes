# Harry Potter, Children's and YA Literature, and Emotional Intelligence
## Concept of literacy
* HP has increased literacy levels and enthusiasm for reading amongst young male readers
* Literacy = the ability to read/write
* True/meaningful literacy is not just functional - considering oneself and self-identifying as a reader
* Sunderland, Dempster, & Thistlethwaite: encouraging further reading, moving forward
* Functional vs holistic literacy affected by Harry Potter

## History of Children's literature, how HP fits in
* Historically viewed as a means of moral instruction: good characters rewarded, bad characters punished: characters in early CL model good/bad behaviour
* The Christmas Box

## Good and evil in children's literature 


## Empathy and emotional intelligence
* Emotional intelligence as a kind of emotional literacy
