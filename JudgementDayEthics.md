## Judgement
* Judgement has a bad name - no one wants to be seen as judgemental
* People jump on each other in a critical and moral way and can dismiss people who possess certain characteristics
* People make moral judgements all the time - e.g. first impressions of people
* We exercise our judgement about people to see whether we can rely on them or if they are 'good'

## The charge against Harry Potter
* There were lots of complants about the Harry Potter series coming from school boards and counties in America
* Some schools have banned the books from their libraries and curriculum
* Complaints suggest the idea of dabbling in the occult
* There are claims that the series is classist, sexist, and hierarchical
    * Is Hermione a token attempt to abolish sexism?
    * Are the children represented as middle-class 'good' kids?
    * Predominantly white characters - is it racist?
* There is a simplistic contrast between good and evil in the series, but there are subtle examples of judgement and ethics
    * Some argue that Harry's lightning-shape scar is a symbol of Satan
    
## The complexity of moral life
* There are issues with rules and principles, and exceptions to them
    * Murder is generally regarded as bad - but would murdering Hitler be bad?
    * Can't imagine a circumstance where rape could be accepted
* We have to consider harm and benefit with regards to utilitarianism
* Rights and duties (deontology) - do practical principles have a moral dimension?
* Caring and compassion are important - what kind of people do we want?
* Principles are not straightforward and there are often exceptions to rules
* We never know who we should trust and who we should not

## Ancient Greece: theories of judgement
* Socrates asked about what kind of life we should lead and how should we live our lives
* Aristotle argued for goodness ('virtue'): a 'trained disposition for making right choices'
    * He believed in conventional virtues
    * The 'golden mean' - our actions define who we are
    * Understanding and clear-sightedness
    * *Eudaimonia* - a life of overall flourishing
* Aristotle's virtue ethics were: friendship, sense of humour, courage, magnanimity, the kalos k'agathos ('gentleman')

## Morals in HP
* 'It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities' (COS)
* A lot of the time we don't get choices and just drift, or do we choose between what is right and what is easy?

## Kant
* He believes that there was only one moral principle that could be willed to a universal principle
* By acting only on this principle, you can will to be universal
* There were two other moral principles - a kingdom of ends, or ends justify the means
* Kant makes morality highly intellectualised - morality is based on how we think about things

## Alasdair MacIntyre: 'After Virtue'
* He is a contemporary philosopher
* Morals were 'constructed out of an amalgam of social and cultural fragments inherited both from different traditions from which our culture was originally derived (Puritan, Catholic, Jewish) and from different stages in and aspects of the development of modernity (the French Enlightenment, the Scottish Enlightenment, nineteenth-century economic liberalism, twentieth-century political liberalism)' (Whose Justice? Whose Rationality?, 1988, p. 2)
* We have inherited an immense series of tradition - we pull these things against each other 
* Logic can pull on decision as well as emotion and instinct

## New moral frameworks
* New ethics systems have developed: feminist, environmental, non-western
* Justice is important in these ethical frameworks

## Truth in Harry Potter
* Dumbledore tries to work with Harry to understand morality - testing out its limits?
* Voldemort: 'there is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it' (PS)
* Slytherin: 'Those cunning folk use any means / To achieve their ends' (PS)
* How moral is Fudge? Is he limited by the bureaucratic system?
* 'refusing, point-blank, to accept the prospect of disruption in his comfortable and ordered world' (GoF) - complex moral world causing discomforts
