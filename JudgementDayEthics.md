## Judgement
* Judgement has a bad name - no one wants to be seen as judgemental
* People jump on each other in a critical and moral way and can dismiss people who possess certain characteristics
* People make moral judgements all the time - e.g. first impressions of people
* We exercise our judgement about people to see whether we can rely on them or if they are 'good'
